# Arthian-Map
This repository is meant to be a historical record of the geography of Easorhn.
### Geography
**Greater Arthia** is a large empire covering most of the Eastern and Western continents of **Easorhn**. 

**Arthia** is the capitol city of **Greater Arthia** and the seat of power for the government. It is centrally located on the western continent to ensure that edicts from the crown reach every corner of **Greater Arthia** at around the same time. The original kingdom of **Arthia** was the area around the city but has fallen into disuse over the centuries. 

The central channel bisecting the empire is known simply as **the Bore**. Due to this geopgraphy, **Greater Arthia** has a thriving marine economy.
A large frontier extends to the East from the settled realms of **Greater Arthia**; **Kargonia** is located centrally in this frontier zone.

There are two other metropli in the empire, **Kargonia** in the northeast frontier and the **Nyissan** port of **Ischia** to the west across **the Bore**. There is a large ciy, though not a metropolis, named **Manteflaro** *(this will change)* located on the southeastern shore at the mouth of the river **Nespo**.
